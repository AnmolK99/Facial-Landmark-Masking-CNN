# Facial-Landmark-Masking-CNN-
Masking Lips and Eyes of Images by a CNN to detect Facial Landmarks

_Dataset used_,
Cleaned Muct Dataset
http://www.milbo.org/muct/
https://github.com/StephenMilborrow/muct (Uncleaned raw ones)
List of training 7049 images. Row containing (x,y) coordinates for 15 keypoints, and image data as row-ordered list of pixels.
List of 1783 test images. Row containing ImageId and image data as row-ordered list of pixels.


This Method is Detecting the 15 Facial Landmarks using CNN,
many other pre-built libraries can be found over the Internet such as ,
- Detector of **dlib** library  which comes with the versatile identification of 68 Facial Landmarks
- **PyTorch** (a well-known one)
- **PyCaret**
